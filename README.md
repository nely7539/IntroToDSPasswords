Online privacy is a growing concern in 2021. Our personal data is priceless, and identity theft, hacking, and unethical data collection puts that at risk. One of the first lines of defense for our personal data is account passwords.

When creating an account, you're often prompted with password strength criteria, such as:

- Must be at least 6 characters
- Contain both letters and numbers
- Uppercase and lower case letters
- Special characters (!, @, #, etc.)

This data analysis explores the most common passwords and their strength, popularity, time it takes to crack, and length.
